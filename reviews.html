          I am so happy that I decided to get my puppy from Adorable Dachshund Home. 
          From the very start it was important to me to find a knowledgeable 
          breeder who loved the breed, who took health and temperament into consideration and a breeder who would take the time to communicate.

          We’ve been wanting a little cream Corgis to join our family for the past few years and have been 
          in communication with Adorable Dachshund throughout the whole time. 
          We were so excited once they had a cream litter. Our little Momo is perfect. She has great temperament - sweet and playful.

          I was very satisfied with the purchase process, communication and ease of dealing with Sarah. 
          I love my puppy. She arrived safely and healthy. 
          The only thing I would suggest is hip test results on both sire and dam for each puppy included in the health certificate. Thank you

          If you do your research you know what a wonderful breed the Dachshund pup is, 
          but you’ll also know that there are specific challenges or potential challenges that come with this breed. 
          So it was important to me to find a breeder that was very knowledgeable and experienced with Dachshund. 
          Someone that I can truly trust. And I found that with Adorable Dachshund Home!!!! 
          She was transparent right from the beginning! She was very helpful and genuine! You feel comfortable asking her anything! 
          She care so much about producing the healthiest dogs. 
          I am beyond thankful for all she had done. If you want a Dachshund Pup, Adorable Dachshund Home is DEFINITELY the breeder to go with.

          Where to start…I found Adorable Dachshund Home online and I’m super happy I did! From the beginning, 
          she was amazing! I was a little nervous about the puppy application because I’ve never had a puppy 
          before but was super excited when we were accepted to the waiting list! We were on the list for around 
          8 months or so before our beautiful little Maeby was born! The entire process from application to puppy 
          selection was pretty seamless and he was and will always happy to provide any info we may need! We ended 
          up with a beautiful blue merle, one of Pudge’s first offspring! Would definitely recommend Adorable 
          Dachshund Home to anyone looking for a healthy well bred pup! Now if I could only convince my husband for puppy #2! 
          I promise Adorable Welsh Corgis Home I’ll be back one day! Until then thanks for our little Maeby ❤️
