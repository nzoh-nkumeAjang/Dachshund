    <p>
      I will accept a deposit to hold a puppy and the balance is due when the puppy is 8 weeks old and ready to go home. 
      <br> 
      No puppy goes home that is not paid for in full.  Thanks for your understanding!

      <h1>Welcome To Adorable Dachshund Puppies Home</h1>
      <p>
        I am a small family breeder of AKC registered Adorable Dachshund Puppies Home. 
        My goal is to breed beautiful, healthy Dachshund puppies, which will bring a lot of joy and happiness to the new owners.
        <br>
        <br>
        My puppies are not kennel raised, but are raised right in my home and treated like my own children. 
        They receive a lot of attention and optimal care. Just take a look through our many photo albums to see. 
        Such as we do sell our puppies with full AKC paperwork, for most cases(based solely on the quality of the 
        dog and fitting into the breeding standard), 
        we need to know, that they will go to the loving homes or to a small hobby breeder. Therefore, we want you to tell us about yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        I offer “guarantee” If you ever read through one of these types of “guarantees” they seller 
        pretty much has an excuse and a way out of everything. (Find a couple on other websites and 
        actually read it and you will see what we mean) However, I do provide at least the first set of 
        vaccination for our pups, as well as health check (eyes, knees, heart, etc) done by our licensed veterinarian. At three months, 
        they are given deworming treatments over specific intervals. I do breed from beautiful and healthy lines with great pedigrees.
        <br>
        <br>
        My New Stud Has A Lot Of Champions In His Pedigree.
        We offer shipping, inside the Canada and USA Shipping is at the customer’s expense. 
        The price of shipping can vary accordingly to the distance. We also offer home delivery.
        <br>
        <br>
        My puppies are all raised with our children and other pets at home with much love and care. 
        They have their own beds and toys but often times they are with me in the living room of our house. If you are interested in buying a 
        Dachshund puppy from me, you can contact us via email or phone and if you are really interested, please fill out the “CONTACT US FORM”
