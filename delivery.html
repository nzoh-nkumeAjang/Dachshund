    <h1>Flight Nanny Information</h1>
    <h2>NANNY FLIGHT</h2>
    <p>
      The flight nannies come expertly trained and well equipped. Flight nannies provide pet carriers 
      for safe transport and will deliver any needed documents, as well. Nannies will have food on hand, 
      provided by me, and water – these will be given along the way when needed. The Nanny will communicate 
      with you before, during, and even after the delivery. Clients will be provided with flight numbers and times, 
      updated with pictures, and even videos of your fur baby’s journey home. 
      Nicole French Bulldog will make sure your puppy is well handle by the transportation agency.
    </p>
    <h2>THE JOURNEY</h2>
    <p>
      While your puppy is traveling from my home to yours , I will make sure to send all necessary details right to your phone. 
      It is my goal to keep everyone on the same page in order to have your puppy have a smooth journey into your arms. 
    </p>
    <h2>IDENTITY VERIFICATION</h2>
    <p>
      For the Clubs protection, I request from all of my travel clients to have ID and credit card verification before 
      the travel arrangements are made. Since I will not be able to verify this information in person, I will request a 
      picture of the cardholder with their Photo ID next to their face, like a selfie, for verification. I will also need a 
      picture of the credit card used for the transaction. I will only need to see the last four of the number as well as the 
      name of the cardholder.  Your 
      transaction will need to be paid in full before we book your flight or ship you any extras you may have purchased alongside your fur baby.

        <h1>1 Year Health Guarantee</h1>
        <p>Offering my clients a memorable adoption experience; my 1 Year Health guarantee comes with every pup. 
          If there is something that later comes up as a hereditary or congenital concern, you will have the peace 
          of mind in knowing that I will stand behind your puppy. Welcoming a new 
          family member into your home is an exciting journey, and I want to provide you with the utmost confidence in your adoption or purchase.

        <h1>Dedicated Partner Breeders</h1>
        <p>
          I value the trusting relationship I have with our partner breeders who share our dedication and commitment to providing 
          clients with healthy and socialized puppies. The health & welfare of My puppies is the top priority. When I visit their homes, 
          it warms My hearts to see their devotion to the exercise, socialization, and exceptional veterinary care of their dogs.
