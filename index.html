          I am so happy that I decided to get my puppy from Adorable Dachshund Home. 
          From the very start it was important to me to find a knowledgeable 
          breeder who loved the breed, who took health and temperament into consideration and a 
          breeder who would take the time to communicate.

          We’ve been wanting a little cream Dachshund to join our family for the past few years and have been 
          in communication with Adorable Dachshund throughout the whole time. 
          We were so excited once they had a cream litter. Our little Momo is perfect. She has great temperament - 
          sweet and playful.
